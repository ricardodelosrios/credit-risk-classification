## Introduction

This data science challenge will use machine learning techniques to investigate the field of credit risk analysis. The main goal is to create and assess a model that, using past loan data from a peer-to-peer lending services provider, can reliably determine borrowers' creditworthiness. By using this research to guide decision-making, the organization will be able to minimize default risk and optimize the health of its lending portfolio.
